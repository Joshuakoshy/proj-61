                Hum Tum a movie released in 2004. here saif ali khan accidently meets rani mukherji at the airport. <br>Their story is about friendship through a period of time. <br>They understand  each other's  attitude, likes/dislikes  and share thier joy and sorrows.<br> The movie also has small snippets of cartoon depicting Hum and Tum.  The final line saying that "Hum is incomplete without TUM " is the punch line.</h4>

            <h4>
                I like her acting skills. she is always bubbly  and also potrays a serious roles. <br> I like her acting skills in other movies like "Bunty and bubbly", "Mujse dosthi karoge" and "HICHKI". Her role Naina Mathur has a B.Ed. and M.Sc. <br>but cannot obtain a teaching position due to her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourette_syndrome" target="_blank">Tourette syndrome</a> which causes uncontrollable sounds likened to hiccups. Despite failing for five years, she is supported by her mother Sudha and her younger brother Vinay.
                </h4>
        <h4> What learnings did i get from Hichki </h4>
        <p>
             I learned about "Tourette Syndrome". Also i learned that with all her short commings - she was committed to her profession and was able to transform a bunch of students into a good educted students.
